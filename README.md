# shoppingcart_modernjs
This is a new repository for the tutorial projects I finished on the Udemy Modern JavaScript course. This tutorial is based on adding courses to the shopping cart of a tutorial training web site.
The tutorial used local storage, DOM traversing, etc to create a cart that courses can be added to from the course cards. Users have the ability to save and delete courses as desired.
